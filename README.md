# A Data Science Project
<b>Introduction :</b>
<p>This data set is a masked data set which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. Solving
this assignment will give you an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA
and data visualisation.</p>
<br><b>Business Understanding :</b>
<p>You may have some experience of travelling to and from the airport. Have you ever used Uber
or any other cab service for this travel? Did you at any time face the problem of cancellation by
the driver or non-availability of cars?</p>
<p>Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these very issues also impact the business
of Uber. If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its
revenue.
As an analyst, you decide to address the problem Uber is facing - driver cancellation and
non-availability of cars leading to loss of potential revenue.</p>
<b>Business Objectives :</b>
<p>The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and
non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your
analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses
of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.</p>
There are six attributes associated with each request made by a customer:
<br>1. Request id: A unique identifier of the request
<br>2. Time of request: The date and time at which the customer made the trip request
<br>3. Drop-off time: The drop-off date and time, in case the trip was completed
<br>4. Pick-up point: The point from which the request was made
<br>5. Driver id: The unique identification number of the driver
<br>6. Status of the request: The final status of the trip, that can be either completed, cancelled by the driver or no cars available
<br><b>Note: For this assignment, only the trips to and from the airport are being considered.</b>
<br>
<br><b>Results Expected :</b>
<br>1. Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber.
<br>Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; identify the most problematic types of requests (city to
airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots.
<br>2. Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.
<li>a. Find the time slots when the highest gap exists</li>
<li>b. Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots</li>
3. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
<br>4. Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
